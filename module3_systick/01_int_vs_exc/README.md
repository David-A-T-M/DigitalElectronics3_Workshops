## 1. Difference between an interrupt and an exception

- Interrupt: An interrupt is an event generated by hardware peripherals (external to the CPU core), such as timers, GPIO, or communication interfaces. Interrupts are asynchronous to the program flow and are managed by the NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller).
- Exception: An exception is an event generated by the CPU core itself, usually due to internal conditions (e.g., reset, NMI, faults, SVC calls, SysTick). Exceptions can be synchronous (caused by the instruction flow) or asynchronous (like NMI or reset).

## 2. Do exceptions have configurable priorities?

- Some exceptions have configurable priorities (e.g., SysTick, PendSV, SVC). Others, like Reset and NMI, have fixed priorities defined by the architecture and cannot be changed.

## 3. Can an exception be disabled?

- Most exceptions cannot be disabled (e.g., Reset, NMI, HardFault). However, some exceptions like SysTick and SVC can be disabled or masked using specific control registers. The ability to disable depends on the exception type.
