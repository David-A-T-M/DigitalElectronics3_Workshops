# ✨ Exercise 3
## LED Blink Every 500 ms with SysTick

## 📝 Statement

> Create a program that toggles an LED every 500 ms using periodic interrupts generated by the SysTick timer.

## 📋 Specifications

- **Output:**
  - LED connected to **P0.22** toggles state every 500 ms.
- **Behavior:**
  - The LED changes state at a 500 ms interval, managed by the SysTick timer and an internal counter.

## 🛠️ Included Versions

- [**Direct register access version**](LPC1769_registers.c)
- [**CMSIS drivers version**](LPC1769_CMSIS_drivers.c)

Both versions meet the specification and allow you to compare register-level programming with driver-based development.

## 🚦 Notes

- The SysTick timer is configured for a 100 ms interval, and the LED toggles every 5 interrupts (500 ms).
- The main loop uses `__WFI()` to reduce CPU usage while waiting for interrupts.
