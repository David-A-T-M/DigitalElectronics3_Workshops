# ✨ Exercise 4
## Hexadecimal Counter on 7-Segment Display with SysTick

## 📝 Statement

> Create a program that displays a hexadecimal counter (0-F) on a 7-segment display, incrementing every second using periodic interrupts generated by the SysTick timer.

## 📋 Specifications

- **Output:**
  - 7-segment display connected to **P2.0-P2.6** shows a hexadecimal digit (0-F).
- **Behavior:**
  - The displayed digit increments every 1 second, cycling from 0 to F and repeating.

## 🛠️ Included Versions

- [**Direct register access version**](LPC1769_registers.c)
- [**CMSIS drivers version**](LPC1769_CMSIS_drivers.c)

Both versions meet the specification and allow you to compare register-level programming with driver-based development.

## 🚦 Notes

- The SysTick timer is configured for a 100 ms interval, and the display updates every 10 interrupts (1 second).
- The main loop uses `__WFI()` to reduce CPU usage while waiting for interrupts.
