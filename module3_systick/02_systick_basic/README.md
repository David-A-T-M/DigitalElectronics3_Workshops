# ✨ Exercise 2
## LED Toggle with SysTick Timer

## 📝 Statement

> Create a program that toggles an LED using periodic interrupts generated by the SysTick timer.

## 📋 Specifications

- **Output:**
  - LED connected to **P0.22** toggles state on each SysTick interrupt.
- **Behavior:**
  - The LED changes state at a fixed interval determined by the SysTick timer configuration.

## 🛠️ Included Versions

- [**Direct register access version**](LPC1769_registers.c)
- [**CMSIS drivers version**](LPC1769_CMSIS_drivers.c)

Both versions meet the specification and allow you to compare register-level programming with driver-based development.

## 🚦 Notes

- The SysTick timer is configured for a 10 ms interval by default.
- The main loop uses `__WFI()` to wait for interrupts, reducing CPU usage.
